# Symfony Console Command

## Requirements

* Let's imagine we have a game two teams, each team have 5 players, every player have drain (level to measure player strength). Below given numbers in brackets represent drain of each players.
* Team A [35, 100, 20, 50, 40]
* Team B [35, 10, 30, 20, 90]

* You need to assign team A player in a way where it exceed team B playerâ€™s drain. Even if one player loses the battle then team A will not win.
* The solution for the above result will be
* Team A [40, 20, 35, 50, 100]
* Team B [35, 10, 30, 20, 90]

* Input: should be from console command to collect all the players data comma separated. Example console command should promote
* Enter A Teams players: 30, 100, 20, 50, 40
* Enter B team players: 35, 10, 30, 20, 90

* If A team can win than the output will be: Win
* If A team lose than the output will be: Lose
